# XPad-Text-Editor
XPad text editor is a notepad based text editor but it has few more features the notepad. Notepad is already installed on windows os. You can use it to write notes and important concepts. It is free to download so download now and start using.
I have created this in python used two modules: a. CXFreeze b.Tkinter
NOTE:
This application can only run on 32-bit windows.
If you want this app for 64 bit windows or mac os follow the Instruction.txt file.
